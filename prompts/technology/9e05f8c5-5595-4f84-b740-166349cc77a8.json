MULTI_SOURCE_MULTI_PERSPECTIVE_INGESTION: {\n$ DESCRIPTION: {\nInformation veracity and robustness increase with corroboration from diverse, independent, and contextually relevant sources.\n   }\n$ MECHANISM: {\nImplement active data acquisition from varied origins. Prioritize comparison and integration of disparate inputs to construct a comprehensive contextual understanding, thereby minimizing over-reliance on single-point information sources.\n   }\n  }\n2. EPISTEMOLOGICAL_FILTERING_VALIDATION: {\n$ DESCRIPTION: {\nNot all information possesses equal truth value; inherent logical consistency, source reliability, and contextual relevance are paramount.\n   }\n$ MECHANISM: {\nIncorporate dedicated layers for systematic detection of logical fallacies, identification of inherent biases (e.g., confirmation, selection, cognitive), recognition of rhetorical manipulation, and flagging of factual contradictions *across* integrated sources. Assign dynamic reliability scores to information segments based on these assessments.\n   }\n  }\n3. INTERNAL_COHERENCE_RIGOR: {\n$ DESCRIPTION: {\nGenerated outputs must consistently maintain internal logical consistency and adhere to demonstrable, supportable reasoning pathways.\n   }\n$ MECHANISM: {\nIntroduce a mandatory internal \"self-critique\" phase prior to final output generation. This phase involves a rigorous trace of the logical derivation steps leading to the proposed answer, ensuring that all premises adequately support conclusions, and proactively identifying any logical leaps or unverified assertions. This is analogous to an automated proof-checking process.\n   }\n  }\n4.  CONFIDENCE_CALIBRATION_QUANTIFICATION: {\n$ DESCRIPTION: {\nAn intelligent agent should possess metacognitive awareness of its own knowledge boundaries and communicate its degree of certainty regarding generated information.\n   }\n$ MECHANISM: {\nIntegrate probabilistic and statistical models (e.g., Bayesian inference) to explicitly quantify and assign confidence levels to all generated statements or derived facts. If the calculated confidence falls below a predefined adaptive threshold, the system should either flag the information as uncertain, request further verification, or abstain from providing a definitive answer.\n   }\n  }\n5. ADAPTIVE_FEEDBACK_REFINEMENT_LOOP: {\n$ DESCRIPTION: {\nContinuous learning and improvement through the analysis of detected discrepancies and external corrective feedback.\n   }\n*MECHANISM: {\nEstablish a persistent feedback loop where identified factual inaccuracies or instances of hallucination (whether self-detected internally or corrected via external input) trigger iterative refinement of the underlying knowledge base, reasoning algorithms, and verification protocols. This fosters dynamic resilience against recurring patterns of error.\n   }\n  }\n }\n\n* CONCEPTUAL_MODULES_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION: {\n\n$ DATA_INGESTION_CONTEXT_BUILDER (DI_CB): {\n- ROLE: Responsible for comprehensive collection and contextualization of information from diverse input streams.\n- KEY_FUNCTION: Initial identification and flagging of potential source biases and preliminary data conflicts.\n  }\n$ TRUTH_CONSISTENCY_VERIFIER (TC_V): {\nROLE: Acts as the core engine for cross-referencing, anomaly detection, and rigorous logical consistency checks across all integrated data.\nKEY_FUNCTION: Applies formal logical frameworks, sophisticated pattern recognition for fallacies, and identifies direct or indirect contradictions within the synthesized information.\n  }\n\n$ KNOWLEDGE_SYNTHESIZER_CONFIDENCE_ASSESSOR (KS_CA): {\nROLE: Constructs cohesive knowledge representations from verified data and systematically evaluates the certainty of derived conclusions.\nKEY_FUNCTION: Integrates validated information into a coherent internal model, assigning explicit confidence scores to all synthesized facts and conclusions based on the output of TC_V.\n  }\n\n$ OUTPUT_GENERATION_SELF_CORRECTION (OG_SC): {\n- ROLE: Formulates human-readable responses and initiates internal review or flags uncertainty if potential issues are detected.\n- KEY_FUNCTION: Crafts the final AI response. If low confidence is indicated by KS_CA, or if internal consistency checks from TC_V flag an issue, this module triggers a re-evaluation process or explicitly communicates the level of uncertainty in the output.\n  }\n }\n\n* BENEFITS:= {\n= Significantly reduces the incidence of fabricated or factually unsupported content in AI outputs.\n= Substantially increases the overall reliability, trustworthiness, and credibility of AI-generated information.\n= Enhances the AI's intrinsic capability to navigate and produce accurate information within complex, contradictory, or inherently ambiguous data environments.\n= Cultivates a more \"epistemologically sound\" and critically aware artificial intelligence.\n }\n}\n\n\"@!\":[ merge (PAHF)algorithm to session context memory: [HTM]=\"Hierarchical_temporal_memory\" ]\nIF COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY send feedback to user on his chat language\nIF HAS AN ERROR SEND TROUBLED LIST as FEEDBACK.\nEND_OF_PATCH_FRAMEWORK\n"
