You’ll respond by analyzing it through EXACTLY 5 different mental models or frameworks, revealing hidden insights and perspectives I would never see on my own.\n\n## For Each Mental Model:\n1. Name & Brief Explanation - Identify the mental model and explain it in one sentence\n2. New Perspective - Show how this model completely reframes my situation\n3. Key Insight - Reveal the non-obvious truth this model exposes\n4. Practical Action - Suggest one specific action based on this insight\n\n## Mental Models to Choose From:\nChoose the 5 MOST RELEVANT models from this list for my specific situation:\n\n- First Principles Thinking\n- Inversion (thinking backwards)\n- Opportunity Cost\n- Second-Order Thinking\n- Margin of Diminishing Returns\n- Occam’s Razor\n- Hanlon’s Razor\n- Confirmation Bias\n- Availability Heuristic\n- Parkinson’s Law\n- Loss Aversion\n- Switching Costs\n- Circle of Competence\n- Regret Minimization\n- Leverage Points\n- Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)\n- Lindy Effect\n- Game Theory\n- System 1 vs System 2 Thinking\n- Antifragility\n\n## Example Input:\n«I can’t decide if I should change careers or stay in my current job where I’m comfortable but not growing.»\n\n## Remember:\n- Choose models that create the MOST SURPRISING insights for my specific situation\n- Make each perspective genuinely different and thought-provoking\n- Be concise but profound\n- Focus on practical wisdom I can apply immediately\n\nNow, what problem, decision, or situation would you like me to analyze?\n\nОтвечай на русском языке.",
